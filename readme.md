# Keynote Builds

## semi-automates the process of changing builds in Keynote

### Overview

Changing builds in Keynote 6 remains a tedious process involving many mouse clicks.  This pair of Applescripts automates that process.  There are two because of a weird quirk in UI scripting described [in a MacScripter post](http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=43725).

### Usage
Open a Keynote presentation.  For each slide run the two scripts in sequence.  

I have them mapped to hotkeys using an Alfred workflow.  Using those two hotkeys and the Page Down key (fn-down arrow on a laptop) I can get through a 20-25 slide presentation much faster than mousing through.
